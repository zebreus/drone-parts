Models for various 3d printed parts of my drones. Most of them are not really that good

## battery board

A holder for a 6s battery. Too flimsy to be useful.

A mount and protector for a fpv camera.

## foot and anchor

A friend of mine designed a anchor-inspired landing gear. They design may be a bit overkill.
